# consumer-reviews-NLP
This repo could be my future workshop material. <br>
In fact, I've completed this project(my NLP course assignment) and received 99% marks out of 100%. 
This is my first NLP project and inspired me to venture in NLP during my internship. I found it is very interesting and want to expose this to my students.
<br> I will try to update this repo asap when I have extra time because my current focus is fully on my internship project.

Title: Explore [ ] consumer reviews using NLP

### Drafting....
### Intro
1. What's the fun part of this project?
2. (Experience sharing) How did I get inspired from it?
3. Will separate the workshop into 2 sections
- Will start with theory explanation
- Following by hands-on (Entry level Python is enough)

### Theory part
1. Intro to NLP (Pipeline is enough, participants can figure out the code form Jupyter notebook)

### Technical part (Not to touch the codes in depth) <br>
Steps:
#### 1. Data mining (Data extraction from Google Play Store, etc) <br>
Refer here for: [Detailed data mining steps for MySejahtera app](data-mining.md)
#### 2. Sentiment analysis using N-gram & POS (Detailed steps have include in Jupyter Notebook files) <br>
Refer here for: [Part of Speech codes](Part_of_Speech.ipynb)
<br> Refer here for: [N gram codes](N-gram.ipynb)
#### 3. Theme impact clustering <br>
Reference: [Kaggle Title Clustering with Theme Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/code/skeller/title-clustering-with-theme-detection/notebook)

### CTA:
#### 1. Utilize Github classroom
#### 2. Let the students fill in the blank on what they have learned & give some rewards
